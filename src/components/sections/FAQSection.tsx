      question: "What are the rules for the Funded Account?",
      answer:
        "The rules for the Funded Account are exactly the same as your Assessment account. However, with a Funded Account, there is no profit target.",
    },

      id: "item-2",
      category: "funded-account",
      question:
        "If I have a hard breach in my Funded Account and there are gains in the account, do I forfeit those gains?",
      answer: `If you have gains in your funded account at the time of a hard breach, you will still receive your portion of those gains.\n\n For example, if you have a $100,000 account and you grow that account to $110,000. Should you then have a hard breach we would close the account. Of the $10,000 in gains in your funded account, you would be paid your portion thereof.`,

      id: "item-3",
      category: "funded-account",
      question: "Am I subject to any position limits?",
      answer:
        `The maximum position that you may open is determined by your available margin.\n\n` +
        `We reserve the right to increase the margin requirement, limit the number of open positions you may enter or maintain in the Funded Account at any time, and to revise in response to market conditions the drawdown levels at which trading in the Funded Account will be halted. We or the Broker reserve the right to refuse to accept any order.`,

    {
      id: "item-5",
      category: "funded-account",
      question: "How do I withdraw the gains in my Funded Account?",
      answer:
        `Traders can request a withdrawal of the gains in their funded account at any time in their trader dashboard, but no more frequently than once per thirty (30) days. So, if you make gain in your funded account, you can request a withdrawal.\n\n` +
        `When you are ready to withdraw the gains from your funded account, click the Withdraw Profits button in your trader dashboard and enter the amount to withdraw. All such gains are distributed via the available outbound payment solutions offered from time to time. Once your withdrawal request is approved, we will pay the monies owed to you. We reserve the right to change the withdrawal methods and options at any time.`,

      id: "item-6",
      category: "funded-account",
      question: "How Long does it take to receive my Funded Account?",

You will receive a confirmation email once this account is being enabled.`,

      id: "item-7",
      category: "funded-account",
      question:
        "Once I pass the Assessment am I provided with a demo or live account?",
      answer: `Once you pass the Assessment, we provide you with a funded account, backed by our capital. The capital in your funded Account is notional and may not match the amount of capital on deposit with the Liquidity Provider. A Funded Account is notionally funded when actual funds in the account (i.e., the equity in a Funded Account represented by the amount of capital) differs from the nominal account size (i.e., the size of the Funded Account that establishes the initial account value and level of trading). Notional funds are the difference between nominal account size and actual capital in a Funded Account use of notional funding does not impact your trading conditions in any way.`,

      id: "item-8",
      category: "funded-account",
      question:
        "When can I withdraw the gains in my Funded Account and how does that affect my maximum drawdown?",
      answer:
        "Your first withdrawal can be requested at any time. Thereafter, you can request a withdrawal of the gains in your account every 30 days. When a withdrawal is approved, we will also withdraw our share of the gains, and your max drawdown will remain unaffected. The drawdown does not reset when you request a withdrawal.",

      category: "funded-account",
      question: "Who is the counterparty to my trades?",
      answer:
        "For purposes of managing risk and minimizing transaction costs, we may offset or negate market risk and act as the direct counterparty to certain trades initiated in the Account. Such trades are executed at prices provided by arm’s length third parties. This framework is intended to ensure you receive real market execution on your trades, while simultaneously allowing us to manage risk dynamically by routing existing positions or future orders to third parties for execution as we deem appropriate. We believe that such real market execution and dynamic risk management would not be possible or as cost-effective if trades were executed in simulated accounts. Regardless of whether we act as counterparty to your trades, the gain or loss on your funded account is not calculated differently. However, when we act as the counterparty to your trades, there is an inherent potential conflict of interest because your trades do not result in net gain or loss to us, as your trades would if we were not the direct counterparty.",

        "This is your new End of Day High-Water Mark, which would mean your new Maximum Trailing Loss would be $97,000.

      question: "What is the Consistency Requirement**?",
      answer:
        "We have a Consistency Requirement to ensure traders aren't hitting profit targets through a few lucky trades. This promotes consistent behavior and punishes YOLO style trading. The calculation is: (best trading day PnL/Total PnL) x 100.\n\n\n\n" +
        "A lower value means profits are generated more consistently across multiple trading days. A higher value means profits are concentrated on fewer trading days. For example, a consistency requirement of 25% means you cannot achieve your entire profit target in less than 4 days (100% / 25% = 4).\n\n\n\n" +
        "You must meet both the profit target and the consistency requirement — maintaining a consistency ratio at or below 25% — to hit your profit target, be eligible for a payout, and to advance to the next Phase.\n\n\n\n" +
        "• Example 1: On a $100k account with a profit target of $8,000, if you earn $2,000 per day over 4 days, you meet the consistency requirement. Your best day is $2,000, and total profit is $8,000 — resulting in a consistency ratio of 25% ($2,000 / $8,000).\n\n\n\n" +
        "• Example 2: On a $100k account with a profit target of $8,000, if your profits across 4 days are $3,000, $1,000, $2,000, and $2,000, you violate the consistency requirement. Your best day is $3,000, and total profit is $8,000 — which gives a consistency ratio of 37.5% ($3,000 / $8,000).\n\n" +

      question: "How do you calculate the Daily Loss Limit?",
      answer: `The Daily Loss Limit is the maximum your account can lose in any given day. Daily Loss Limit is calculated using the previous day balance which resets at 5 PM EST. Unlike other firms, we do NOT base our calculations on previous day equity since the balance only model allows you to scale profits without fear of losing your account. The Daily Stop compounds with the increase in your account.

Example: If your prior day's end of day balance (5pm EST) was $100,000, your account would violate the daily stop loss limit if your equity reached $95,000 during the day. If your floating equity is +$5,000 on a $100,000 account, your new-day (5pm EST) max loss is based on your balance from the previous day ($100,000). So, your daily loss limit would still be $95,000.`,

      question: "How do you calculate the Max Drawdown (STATIC)?",
      answer: `Maximum drawdown is the maximum your account can drawdown before you would hard breach your account. When you open the account, your Maximum Drawdown is set at a defined % of your starting balance. This % is static and does not trail. If you have gains in your funded account at the time of a hard breach, you will still receive your portion of those gains.`,

      category: "trading-rules",
      question:
        "What is the difference between a Hard Breach and Soft Breach rule?",
      answer: `Soft breach means that we will close all trades that have violated the rule. However, you can continue trading in your Assessment or Funded Account.

Hard breach means that you violated either the Daily Loss Limit or Max Drawdown rule. Both rules constitute a hard breach. In the event you have a hard breach, you will fail the Assessment or have your Funded Account taken away.`,

        `Maximum drawdown is the maximum your account can drawdown before you would hard breach your account. When you open the account, your Maximum Drawdown is set at 6% of your starting balance. This 6% is static and does not trail.\n\n` +
        `The Maximum Trailing Drawdown is initially set at 6% and trails (using CLOSED BALANCE - NOT equity) your account until you have achieved a 6% return in your account. Once you have achieved a 6% return the Maximum Trailing Drawdown no longer trails and is permanently locked in at your starting balance. This allows for more trading flexibility.`,

        "We believe in sound risk management using stop losses. To that end, we require a stop loss on every trade. If you fail to place a stop loss at the time of placing the trade/order, we will close the trade. This is only a soft breach rule, so you can continue trading in your account.",
